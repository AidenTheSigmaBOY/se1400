        <h4>Geolocation - where the primary audience lives.</h4>
        <p>Most of my audience should live in the United States of America because most (if not all) of the games I'll
            be covering are games that are popular here in the US.</p>
        <h4>Age - Specify the age ranges (within a decade) that will primarily be using the site.</h4>
        <p>My target audience is people around my age. They should be between 13-21 because the games I'll be
            documenting updates for aren't for older audiences.</p>
        <h4>Gender - the gender of the majority of your users.</h4>
        <p>The target gender for my site will be male. This is because males are a lot more likely to play video games
            and care deeply about keeping up with the timelines and schedules of their games.</p>
        <h4>Other - demographics are commonly used to identify the users.</h4>
        <p>The biggest demographic I want to target with this site is gamers. That's my only goal. This site is made for
            gamers alike, so that's why they're the most important target.</p>
