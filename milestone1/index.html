        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>This website will contain all of my personal favorite games (as well as some others) and their updating
            schedule. The info included will be when the game was last updated, and when the next update is planned to
            be.</p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for you site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>The text info will come from many different sources depending on the game that's being updated. I may go to
            the game's official website, or maybe their social media to see if there's any info on future or past
            updates. As for the images, I will most likely get those from offical websites as well, but if the game
            doesn't have a website, I may grab a picture from Google.</p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>Users should care because I will make it my mission to do the best job I can. Not only that, I will make the
            site as engaging and informational as possible.</p>
