        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>This website will contain all of my personal favorite games (as well as some others) and their updating
            schedule. The info included will be when the game was last updated, and when the next update is planned to
            be.</p>
        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for you site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>The text info will come from many different sources depending on the game that's being updated. I may go to
            the game's official website, or maybe their social media to see if there's any info on future or past
            updates. As for the images, I will most likely get those from offical websites as well, but if the game
            doesn't have a website, I may grab a picture from Google.</p>
        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>Users should care because I will make it my mission to do the best job I can. Not only that, I will make the
            site as engaging and informational as possible.</p>
        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>Because it's a great visualization of the timeline of many different video games, spanning across multiple
            genres.</p>
        <h4>What would you like user to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>I would like people to be informed when they visit my site, to have a clear visual of updates that have
            happened and are to come, and for people enjoy the site's ease-of-use as well as the visuals.</p>
        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>My goal is to help people be informed on the updates of many games. I'll keep my sources updated so that
            gamers will be informed on up-coming updates, as well as past updates and what they included. My goal is to
            make this site as fun and educational as possible.</p>
