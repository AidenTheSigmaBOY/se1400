        <h2>Competition Analysis</h2>
        <h4>Who are my competitors?</h4>
        <p>My competitors are the offical websites for games. Not only that, but I also have competitors like wikipedia and google because those also contain the info I'm presenting.</p>
        <h4>What are they doing right?</h4>
        <p>Some of my competitors are far more offical and known. Take google, they've been around for decades.</p>
        <h4>What are they doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>None of those sources have the in-depth experience that I have because I play the games I review and add dates to. They are slightly soulless when it comes to the games because they lack the gaming experience.</p>
        <h4>What can I do better?</h4>
        <p>My website, unlike the others, will be a lot more life-filled and passionate. I won't use AI overviews, but I'll make my website easy and fun to be informed.</p>
